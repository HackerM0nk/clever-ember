I am currently a **Product Security Engineer** at **Sprinklr**, where I specialize in **Software Security** and **Platform Engineering**. 

I treat engineering as a **disciplined craft**‚Äîrooted in first principles, careful trade-offs, and evidence-driven decisions. My expertise spans from C/C++ and system internals to distributed cloud platforms, always shaped by clear purpose and careful constraints.

**Security isn't a bolt-on; it's a property that emerges from sound design.** I favor bounded contexts with validated inputs, explicit trust boundaries, least-privilege access, encrypted data paths, and runtime policy enforcement‚Äîso protection is continuous and failure stays local.

Beyond work, I'm a **bibliophile** drawn to Ancient History, Classic Literature, Mathematics, Psychology, and Systems Thinking. Thucydides and Dostoevsky sit beside CLRS, SICP and GEB‚Äîreminders that patterns repeat and feedback loops decide what endures.

**Craft over Hype!**  
**Fundamentals over Shortcuts!**  
**Steady in Cause; Antifragile in Effect...**
